NMN is phosphorylated to NMN-AMP (NMNAT enzyme, 3 isoforms in nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria) and then adenylated to NAD+. This bypasses the NAMPT bottleneck, making NMN more efficient than nicotinamide at restoring NAD+ in aged tissue. NAD+ is consumed by: SIRT1–7 (deacetylases regulating DNA repair, mitophagy, inflammatory gene expression), PARP1/2 (DNA strand break repair), NNMT (methylation sink), and CD38/CD157 (ectoenzymes that rise with age and compete for NAD+). Restoring NAD+ simultaneously improves all of these systems.',

Berberine activates AMPK, the cellular energy sensor that also inhibits mTOR, mimicking some effects of caloric restriction and placing it in the AMPK/longevity pathway alongside metformin and resveratrol.',

NMN supports mitophagy via SIRT1/SIRT3 activation; Ca-AKG supports it via TCA cycle optimization. Mitophagy is why you cannot \"energy boost\" your way out of mitochondrial dysfunction — you need to remove the damaged units first.' },
  { term: 'SASP', simple: 'Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype — the inflammatory cocktail of cytokines, proteases, and growth factors secreted by senescent (zombie) cells.', why: 'SASP is why a small number of senescent cells can damage a large surrounding tissue area. The SASP cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, MMP-3) drive chronic inflammation, disrupt tissue structure, and signal neighboring cells to senesce. Clearing senescent cells (senolytics) or suppressing SASP (senostatics) is the goal of dasatinib+quercetin protocols. NMN and resveratrol have partial SASP-suppressive effects via NAD+/SIRT1.' },

This is why GlyNAC + sulforaphane form the oxidative stress reduction core of the TNiC NRF2 Defense preset.' },

However, we strongly recommend baseline labs (CBC, metabolic panel, hs-CRP, and optionally glutathione or NAD+ metabolites) within your first 90 days.

TNiC curates 14 evidence-graded compounds — every one with PubMed-cited human data — selected for the strongest mechanistic coverage across all 12 hallmarks. Quality and synergy beat quantity.

Tier B additions (taurine, spermidine, pterostilbene) follow the same ramp rule. High-priority interactions: resveratrol and pterostilbene affect platelet function — avoid if on blood thinners.

R-ALA should be taken with fat for best absorption.',

    question: 'Can cold therapy or sauna replace supplement stacks?',
    answer: 'No. Cold exposure activates cold-shock proteins and norepinephrine. Sauna upregulates heat shock proteins. Neither directly restores NAD+ or rebuilds glutathione. Treat thermal stress as a synergistic adjunct — not a replacement for mechanistic substrate restoration.',

    answer: 'A 2024 SLEEP Journal study (PMID: 38593841) found adults under 6 hours per night accumulated 1.8 extra years of epigenetic aging annually vs 7-9 hour sleepers. Sleep is when SIRT1 and PARP peak, mitophagy clears damaged mitochondria, and the glymphatic system flushes amyloid. Treat sleep as non-negotiable.',

    question: 'Should I take these supplements every day or cycle them?',

NMN has the Yoshino 2021 Science study showing muscle metabolic effects (PMID: 33888596). TNiC rates NMN as Tier A and NR as Tier B. Consistency of dosing matters more than the choice between them.',

    answer: 'Oral glutathione is cleaved in the gut before absorption — you absorb the component amino acids, not the intact tripeptide. GlyNAC supplies glycine and N-acetylcysteine, the two rate-limiting precursors the body uses to synthesize glutathione intracellularly. Three human RCTs confirm intracellular glutathione is rebuilt at 24 weeks, something direct glutathione supplementation fails to achieve at equivalent doses.',

    question: 'Does intermittent fasting synergize with longevity supplement stacks?',
    answer: 'Yes — with timing discipline. Fasting activates AMPK and suppresses mTORC1, priming autophagy. Time NMN and Ca-AKG to your eating window (not fasted) since they require substrate availability. Sulforaphane and spermidine can be taken fasted. R-ALA needs fat co-ingestion. Avoid dosing resveratrol with fatty meals — it competes with SIRT1 activation that fasting has already primed.',

    answer: 'Metformin is a biguanide prescription drug — not a supplement. Though the TAME trial (Targeting Aging with Metformin) is underway, evidence for longevity outcomes in non-diabetic adults remains incomplete. Metformin also blocks the muscle hypertrophy response to exercise via AMPK interference — a significant tradeoff.

They secrete the SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype) — a cocktail of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, MMP-3) that damages neighboring tissue. Senescent cell accumulation correlates with every major age-related disease. TNiC maps senolytic-adjacent compounds (spermidine, resveratrol, NMN) to the senescence hallmark in Stack Architect.',

    answer: 'The big five: (1) Starting 5+ compounds simultaneously — you cannot attribute effects or side effects. (2) Using unverified brands with no third-party COA. (3) Ignoring drug interactions — especially resveratrol with blood thinners. (4) Expecting results in under 8 weeks — biology is slow. (5) Not tracking biomarkers — you are flying blind without baseline labs. TNiC\'s Stack Architect and Lab Hub are designed to prevent all five.',

    question: 'Does TNiC store or share my health data?',
    answer: 'No. TNiC is built on a local-first architecture. Your quiz results, biomarker logs, stack configurations, and biological age inputs are stored in your own browser — never transmitted to TNiC servers or third parties. There is no account system, no user database, and no data monetization. Clearing your browser storage erases your data permanently. This is a deliberate design choice, not a marketing claim.',

    question: 'How does the TNiC quiz generate a personalized stack preset?',
    answer: 'The quiz maps three inputs — primary goal (learn the science, cellular defense, mitochondrial energy, full optimization, longevity/healthspan, or cardio-metabolic health), age range, and supplement experience — to one of six mechanistic presets: Starter, NRF2 Defense, Mito-NAD+, Full Hybrid, Longevity Pro (senolytic focus), or Cardio-Metabolic (AMPK/lipid focus). Each preset is a curated subset drawn from 14 evidence-graded compounds optimized for synergy coverage across the relevant hallmarks. No black-box algorithm — every mapping is transparent in the methodology section.',

    question: 'Can longevity supplements reverse aging or just slow it?',
    answer: 'Honest answer: current evidence supports slowing measurable aging biomarkers and, in some cases, reversing specific deficits — not reversing aging wholesale. GlyNAC restored glutathione and mitochondrial function to levels resembling younger adults. Ca-AKG reduced epigenetic age by ~8 years in one trial. NMN restored muscle NAD+ metabolism. These are meaningful, measurable changes in specific mechanisms — not the return of youth.',

    question: 'What are the head-to-head comparison tables and how were they built?',
    answer: 'TNiC\'s comparison tables are neutral, PMID-anchored side-by-side analyses across key decision dimensions — mechanism, bioavailability, human RCT evidence, timing, cost, and stack synergy. Each row cites a specific published study. There are no sponsored results, undisclosed affiliate arrangements, or score inflation. Current tables: NMN vs NR, GlyNAC vs liposomal glutathione, Resveratrol vs Pterostilbene, Berberine vs Metformin, Urolithin A vs CoQ10, NMN vs Spermidine, and others. Find them at /library/compare.',

    question: 'How does the TNiC buyer guide work — and why does it not recommend specific brands?',
    answer: 'Each compound in the library has a buyer guide that lists: (1) required form on the label (e.g., "ubiquinol" not "CoQ10" without form disclosure); (2) COA demands — the specific assays to request from any manufacturer; (3) evidence-anchored dose range matched to the trial doses that produced results; and (4) red flags that disqualify a product immediately. TNiC earns zero revenue from products. The buyer guide is an intelligence checklist so you can evaluate any brand against objective criteria — not a product recommendation that could be biased by undisclosed compensation.',
